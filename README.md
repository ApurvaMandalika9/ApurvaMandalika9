# 👩‍💻 Welcome to My GitHub!

👋 Hello! I’m a passionate Data Scientist with a Master’s in Computer Science from Texas A&M University 🎓.

💼 I have a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analytics, and Augmented Reality, backed by over 4 years of professional experience at [24]7.ai . During my time there, I worked on AR-driven customer support tools, predictive analytics, and other innovative solutions.

📚 My journey began with a B.Tech in Computer Science from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, which laid the groundwork for my technical expertise.
